I wanted a project to do some machine learning which uses publicly available data so I can share it. 
Thus, I took this data from Kaggle dataset. It seems interesting to do some feature engineering with it.
movie_metadata.csv : data
Untitled.ipynb : My jupyter notebook
inflation.csv : A file I generated with my notebook and now read to convert money from different time into 2017 $.
